## Sentiment Analysis

Web scraping: The code we used scrapes article titles and dates from the WSJ archive for a
specified date range and stores the information in an Excel file. We scraped the archive year
by year to speed up the process, and we then appended all databases.
Sentiment Analysis: Once we had the complete database, we created two indicators; the first
points to all articles mentioning the war in Palestine. The second points to those mentioning
the war in Ukraine. Subsequently, we employed a code that conducts sentiment analysis on the
titles based on the two indicators and calculates the yearly average sentiment score for each
indicator. The results are then stored in Excel files that are used for plotting the Sentiment Trends accross the years.
